/**
 * GameStateSubsystems offer an alternative to UGameStateComponent for compositional systems that need
 * to be replicated and part of the GameState lifetime. With GameStateComponents typically you would use
 * Lyra's Experience system to compose which components are active in certain contexts or you just manually
 * add them as subobjects. This subsystem type is by no means a replacement for GameState Components and
 * you should be aware there is times where they are more suitable.
 *
 * The time when GameStateSubsystems are useful is for systems that are for the most apart unconditionally
 * available and need to be a modular extension of the GameState itself. Since they are automatically registered
 * you only need to create the subsystem and the functionality will run as long as the GameState is alive.
 *
 * It's also worth nothing that GameStateSubsystems are essentially there to serve a similar purpose to world
 * subsystems. However their dependency on the GameState greatly simplifies replication context, since world
 * subsystems existing during obscure times in the world lifecycle, and due to their singleton nature, you can't
 * have multiple instances of them on the server, which would be required if the player is authoritative over
 * their own subsystem (similarly to a player controller). For that functionality I recommend UControllerComponent.
